📘 Linear Regression Project

This notebook demonstrates Linear Regression using multiple approaches to understand and analyze model behavior.
The project includes all essential stages of a Data Science workflow, starting from data preparation to model evaluation.

🔍 Project Overview:

Data Science Process: Applied the full pipeline from data understanding to validation.

Data Visualization: Used various plots to explore relationships and detect patterns.

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized features.

Model Building: Implemented Linear Regression using different methods (e.g., manual computation, scikit-learn, gradient descent).

Model Validation: Evaluated performance using metrics such as R², MAE, and MSE to assess accuracy and reliability.

This notebook provides a complete, step-by-step walkthrough for understanding Linear Regression both theoretically and practically.
