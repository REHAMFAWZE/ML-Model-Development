# Linear Regression Project ðŸ“ˆ

## Idea  
This project applies and analyzes **Linear Regression** using multiple approaches to understand model behavior and explore the relationship between independent and dependent variables.  
The main goal is to gain a **practical understanding of linear regression** as part of the **Data Science learning path**.

## Stages  
1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned the dataset and handled missing values.  
   - Encoded and normalized features to prepare them for modeling.  

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Visualized relationships between variables using different plots.  
   - Explored correlations and insights that affect the target variable.  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Implemented Linear Regression using several approaches:  
     - Manual mathematical computation.  
     - Using **scikit-learn** library.  
     - Applying **Gradient Descent** to iteratively optimize the model parameters.  

4. **Model Validation**  
   - Evaluated model performance using key metrics:  
     - **RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)**  
     - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
     - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**  
   - Compared results across different methods and analyzed performance differences.

## Results  
- Built multiple Linear Regression models on the same dataset.  
- Found that **Gradient Descent** and **scikit-learn** approaches achieved similar accuracy.  
- Data normalization helped improve model performance and stability.
